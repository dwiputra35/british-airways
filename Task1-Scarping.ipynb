    "1. **Web Scraping**: Utilize the website Skytrax to gather review data about the airline. You can use the provided Jupyter Notebook in the Resources section to execute Python code that will assist in data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Analysis**: Once you have your dataset, prepare it by cleaning the messy and text-heavy data. After cleaning, conduct your own analysis to uncover insights. You might consider sentiment analysis, topic modeling, or generating word clouds to gain insights into the content of the reviews. It's recommended to complete this task using Python, but you can use any tool of your choice. Utilize the documentation websites provided in the Resources section to analyze the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Presenting Insights**: Create a single PowerPoint slide that summarizes your findings. Include visualizations and metrics in this slide, along with clear and concise explanations to quickly convey the key points from your analysis. Use the provided PowerPoint template to create this slide.\n",
